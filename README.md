## Just Your Average Text Editor

## Description
Just Your Average Text Editor is as the name implies, a browser-run text-editor deployed via Render. When a user opens up the application, they should be able to console.log strings of code, text, etc and see it in real time. When the page reloads, the user is still able to see what was written previously on the page until the user themselves removes the text data.

Render Deployed Website:

## Installation
J.A.T.E has no installation prerequisites, making it easy for users to implement. All a user needs to do is navigate to the site via the link above and use as they see fit. 

## Usage
J.A.T.E is perfect for small scale coding. With its' ability to keep previous information available for users even when the page is refreshed, J.A.T.E allows users to 'jump back in' to their code with little trouble or resistance. As it has its' own automatic save feature, a user just needs to pull it back up on their browser and they should be more than fine. Keep in mind that it may not work the same way on another browser or device, as it depends on local storage to keep the data input into its' system.

## Support
If for some reason the application isn't working, please feel free to contact me here on GitHub or via my email: Leesamarie95@gmail.com for any questions or concerns. I'll do my best to trouble shoot, and, if in the event that I myself am running into issues, the GitHub help forums, Stack Overflow forums, and even the Render forums can be wonderful tools to implement when working through errors. 

## Roadmap
There are plenty of things I'd love to work on to make this truly my own. Most of these include account features and an actual install feature, but for the most part my ideas are as follows:

- Implement a Sign Up/Login/Logout/Account feature that allows users to save all codes on to an account so they can have several projects going at once. 
- Implement HTML, CSS, and JavaScript real time editing to allow users to see their work update as one cohesive piece of work as they code for easier troubleshooting.
- Allow users to install the text editor on to their preferred device for portability and ease of use. 
- Implement a mobile friendly version of the text editor for those on the go.

## Contributing
I would love contributors to help make my roadmap into a reality. I only really ask that those familiar with Express.js, Node, Java, HTML, and CSS come flocking (as it's also what I'm currently learning as well). We're all continuing to learn, so please feel free to join in if you're just starting out as well!

As this project runs with Node and Express, I highly suggest having those loaded on to your computer before interacting with the coding itself, as it won't work otherwise. When it is, go through the 'npm install' and 'npm start' calls in your terminal to get the program running on the localhost:3000 port, and dive in! I suggest poking through the console log under the Inspect element, and the Application log just to see how the application is storing values.

## Authors and acknowledgment
I'd like to thank my teachers for their consistent patience with my foolhardy questions, as well as my fellow classmate Kyle G. for walking me through the process of making sure my code was actually functioning. I'd also like to thank GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/stellalph">stellalph</a> for having such a comprehensive version of this code already in a repository for me to poke through and see where I needed to feasibly start. I'd still be scratching my head on where to begin without users like them guiding baby coders like myself.

## Project status
This project is still ongoing, albeit slowly. I would love to implement the features described in #Roadmap, however with my time constrictions, that will have to wait until I have a little more time and knowledge under my belt.
